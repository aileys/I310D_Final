# I310D_Final
We began by obtaining my data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset titled  “Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity – Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.” This dataset includes public health information related to behavioral risk factors such as diet, exercise, obesity, and more, collected through large-scale health surveys. The dataset is publicly available and offers a wide range of variables, including demographic information like age, race/ethnicity, education level, and sex, as well as specific survey responses and corresponding values. 
After loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame using Python, we narrowed down the information to include only the most relevant columns for my analysis. The original dataset contained many variables, but not all of them were necessary for our research purposes. To make the data easier to analyze and more focused, we created a filtered version that kept only the columns we were most interested in: Race/Ethnicity, Location Description, Age (years), Education, Sex, Data Value, Year Start, Question, and Data Value Unit. 
By filtering the dataset, we removed unnecessary clutter and made the data more manageable for any future analysis I plan to perform. For example, this streamlined dataset will allow me to more easily examine how factors like education level or age influence obesity rates, or how these patterns vary across different regions and ethnic groups. After filtering, we saved the new, cleaned version as a separate CSV file.
